# Bookly

This assignment demonstrates a functioning book search and save web app, using React and Apollo/GraphQL. Users can create new accounts, search for books available through the google books API, and save books to a list that persists with their account. Queries are handled via GraphQL, and the MongoDB database is stored in Atlas. Session information is stored via JWT tokens.

## Site
